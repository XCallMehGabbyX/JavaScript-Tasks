        Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – ask them to input again.
        The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the input/enters an empty line.
        Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no need to implement a special handling for a non-numeric input in this task.

        An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything except 1 and itself.

        In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it can’t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.

        For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4.

        Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.
